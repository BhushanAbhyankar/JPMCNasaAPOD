#  NASA APOD 


Challenge Statement:

iOS
Create an app which uses the NASA APOD API (https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).
Basic Features:
•    On launch of the app, it should load the date, title, image, and the explanation for the current day's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day). On some days, the image is replaced by an embedded video. The app should handle this scenario as well. (Example 11th October 2021 APOD). Please ensure to use a Tab Bar as it will help when later you are asked to expand on the solution.
•    Allow the user to load the NASA APOD for any day that they want. 
•    Last service call including image should be cached and loaded if any subsequent service call fails.
Bonus Features:
•    Solution should work on both iPhone and iPad and different orientations. 
•    Dark Mode support.
•    Dynamic Type Accessibility. 
The solution should be production ready, and the candidate is requested to upload the code to GitHub (or any public repository) and share the link with the team when completed. Bonus features are not compulsory and any solutions without them will be evaluated as normal. The coding style, architecture, testability, stability, and extendibility of the solution will be assessed by the team. The minimum deployment target of the solution should be iOS 16.0.
Candidates are requested to not use any third-party frameworks and to not use any confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information in the code. Any solution will be used for JPMC's internal purposes only.
